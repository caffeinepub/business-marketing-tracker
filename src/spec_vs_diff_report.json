  "summary": "REQ-28 appears implemented via a mobile sticky header wrapper on DashboardPage keeping the header/Add Entry button visible with background/spacing/z-index. REQ-30 appears implemented by introducing a shared response status style helper and applying it to badges in the Recent Posts table and Follow-up reminders. REQ-29 is only partially evidenced: copy logic exists, but the required explicit \"Copy to Clipboard\" button placement/labeling and disabled-on-empty behavior are not clearly shown, and the code currently shows an error toast instead of disabling the button.",

      "requirement": "Each of the 3 hook template cards shows a button labeled \"Copy to Clipboard\" in the card header area next to the hook title.",

      "requirement": "If the template content is empty/whitespace, the \"Copy to Clipboard\" button is disabled and the app does not attempt to copy.",
      "reason": "The shown handleCopy implementation checks for empty content and triggers a toast error, but there is no evidence the button is disabled; additionally the flow still allows a user action that results in an error message rather than a disabled control.",

      "requirement": "Tapping \"Copy to Clipboard\" copies the corresponding template content using the existing clipboard flow.",
      "reason": "The implementation uses navigator.clipboard.writeText directly; there is no evidence it reuses an existing app clipboard utility/flow (if one exists).",
