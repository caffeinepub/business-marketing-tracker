# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the Marketing Tracker mobile UX and scanning speed by keeping key actions accessible, making template copying explicit, and visually distinguishing response statuses.

**Planned changes:**
- Make the Dashboard (Marketing Tracker) header area sticky on phone-sized viewports so the “Add Entry” button remains visible while scrolling, without overlapping content.
- On HookTemplateLibraryPage, add a clearly labeled “Copy to Clipboard” button on each of the 3 hook template cards that copies that card’s template content (disabled when content is empty/whitespace).
- Color-code Response Status badges throughout the Marketing Tracker UI, including the Recent Posts table, with distinct styling per status (e.g., Leads Generated = green, No Response = gray; other statuses visually distinct).

**User-visible outcome:** On mobile, users can always access “Add Entry” while scrolling; users can copy any hook template via an explicit button; and response statuses are easier to scan at a glance due to consistent color-coded badges.
